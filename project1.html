    <p style="color: aliceblue";>In a dramatic World Cup final match-up between Argentina and the defending champions France, Lionel Messi led his team and nation to their first World Cup win since 1986. In what many believed to be his last World Cup appearance, the 35-year-old scored two of the three goals in regulation and overtime play. Netting his penalty, Messi led Argentina to win against France, who  missed two of their penalty kicks in the shootout round, 4-2.</p>
